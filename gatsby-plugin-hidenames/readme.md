# gatsby-plugin-hidenames
Renames files in the build folder to use file hashes instead of component paths

```sh
npm i gatsby-plugin-hidenames
```

**This has a lot of stuff hardcoded and will probably break if used with other plugins or an update to Gatsby**

`gatsby-config.js`
```
{
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-hidenames'
  ]
}
```
